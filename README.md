# JavaScript Features

JavaScript is the scripting language of the web. Embeded within HTML, JavaScript can create websites that do great things. Some examples include online games, online document editing, and even apps you can download and run on your phone!

This is intended as a guide for those looking to get into programming for the web. It is incomplete, but provides some ideas on what one can do and what one might Google to learn more. Most sections are classified as *Basic*, *Intermediate*, or *Advanced* based on how difficult I consider it to work with the technologies involved.

## *BASIC* Console

Browsers support a JavaScript console, which includes the ability to print out debug messages & a REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop). The console can be accessed in Chrome by clicking the three dots menu > More Tools > Developer Tools and clicking on console. There you can evaluate arbitrary JavaScript.

# JavaScript Application Program Interfaces (APIs)


## *Intermediate* Web Requests

If you need to load resources dynamically, or interact with servers then web requests are your friend. You may run into trouble with the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

## *Intermediate* DOM manipulation

Control HTML from JavaScript. The Document Object Model (DOM) lets you interact with existing elements, create new ones, and change their properties (style, content, etc.). Developers often use libraries instead of using the browser's built in API. One such library is [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

## *Intermediate* Canvas element

A visual element that allows drawing custom shapes, lines, and images to the screen. Useful in the designing of games, image manipulation (filters etc.), and the design of other advanced graphical applications.

## *Advanced* WebGL

Allows 3D Drawing and Shading capabilities in the browser. Extremely efficient and easier to work with than many 3d libraries, but requires advanced knowledge in order to proplerly use. Libraries available that make the process easier (try [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)). Low poly 3d models reccomended, as your projects usually won't be running on computers built for AAA games.

## *Intermediate* File Manipulation

JavaScript can open files users provide to a web page and interact with them, including creating new files. By default, JavaScript has built in functions supporting the parsing of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

## *Advanced* Progressive Web Applications

JavaScript is still evolving and progressive web applications are one of the coolest new things you can do with it. See a google primer on the subject [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/).

## *Intermediate* Async Functions & Promises

JavaScript provides powerful tools to deal with asyncronous tasks through promises and async functions. Learn about promises [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises) and async functions [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/async-functions).
